       This shell attempts to predict the command  and  arguments
       which  are being typed by the user.  These predictions are
       based on information taken from all commands typed by  the
       user.   The extracted information consists of the commands
       used, the arguments used with each command, the  directory
       in  which a command is executed and the transition between
       pairs of commands.  As well as automatic updating  of  the
       data the user may make modifications to the data manually.

       When typing at the command line, a prediction may be  dis-
       played  in  place of the line typed so far.  At this point
       the user has a number of options:  _a_c_c_e_p_t  the  prediction
       and  _e_x_e_c_u_t_e  the  command line, _a_c_c_e_p_t the prediction and
       _m_o_v_e onto the _n_e_x_t _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t or _r_e_j_e_c_t  the  given  predic-
       tion.

       To  accept  and execute hit _<_R_E_T_U_R_N_> whilst the prediction
       is displayed.  To accept and move onto the  next  argument
       hit  _<_T_A_B_>  and  the  cursor will move to the start of the
       next argument.  To reject  the  prediction  the  user  may
       either  continue  typing  the next characters in the argu-
       ment, or hit _<_B_A_C_K_S_P_A_C_E_> to remove the prediction from the
       screen reverting back to the line as typed so far.

       Once  a command has been executed _s_u_c_c_e_s_s_f_u_l_l_y the associ-
       ated data is updated and the new command added  if  neces-
       sary.   A  number  of  _b_u_i_l_t_-_i_n _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s exist to view and
       modify the data held.  All these built-ins have the common
       prefix _!_@_.

       -f filename
              This  option  allows  the selection of a file other
              than the  default  _$_H_O_M_E_/_._l_a_s_h_d_a_t_a_.   If  the  file
              specified  does  not  exist a new file will be cre-
              ated.


              Using this option the  user  may  have  data  files
              which  are  tailored  for  particular  projects  or
              applications.  Although any  use  may  be  made  of
              these  files,  it is suggested that when working on
              more than one  project  with  widely  variant  com-
              mand/argument  sets  specific  files should be kept
              for each project.  This will lead  to  an  improved
              prediction quality.

       If the line typed so far is:

              mail gj

       the shell may show the full line as:

              mail gjohnson

       In which case I would type _<_R_E_T_U_R_N_> to send mail to
       gjohnson,  _<_T_A_B_>  to  add  extra  arguments  to  the line,
       _<_B_A_C_K_S_P_A_C_E_> to revert back to _m_a_i_l _g_j or  further  charac-
       ters to append to _m_a_i_l _g_j_.

       This is meant only as a prototype product and as such some
       of the more advanced features commonly found in Unix  com-
       mand  shells  may  not  be available in this product.  For
       example, _p_i_p_e_s_, _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_e_s and  _r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  are
